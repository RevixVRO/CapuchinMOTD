RevixChin has posted an new announcemnt.

We have got access to the Capuchin Remake thx to mloderator. But the remake will not be available to the public and will only be available to close friends and such. Asking for the APK will result in a "staff suspension" (If your staff) and a 6 hour mute in discord and 2 day ban in game (If we can track you).
